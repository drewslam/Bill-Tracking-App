A simple bill tracker app that records items by Creditor Name, Total Amount Due, Monthly Payment, and Due Date during the month.

Originally planned on using dynamically allocated arrays but rewriting to use a linked list instead, as it is easier to delete a list node without having to reallocate the entire list.

Create a menu-driven app that displays the list of bills, adds, modifies, and deletes bills.

Fixed a persistent bug in which my LinkedList display function did not correctly display what should have been the full List.

Next I would like to attack the challenge of outputting the contents of the list to a csv file.

I need to diagnose why my program isn't open export.csv. I would also like to create a database for default storage using PostgreSQL.
