A simple bill tracker app that records items by Creditor Name, Total Amount Due, Monthly Payment, and Due Date during the month.

Originally planned on using dynamically allocated arrays but rewriting to use a linked list instead, as it is easier to delete a list node without having to reallocate the entire list.

Create a menu-driven app that displays the list of bills, adds, modifies, and deletes bills.
